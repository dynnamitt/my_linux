I prefer to make a .deb package:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get build-dep dwm

mkdir dwm
cd dwm
apt-get source dwm

edit config.def.h with your favourite editor and save it as config.h
(I also need to rename config.def.h to for example original-config)
sudo apt-get -b source dwm
(note -b switch

sudo dpkg -i dwm*.deb

and you are done.
